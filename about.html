        <p>Hi! I'm Sara, a Portuguese living in London. I've done my BA in Lisbon, where I got very interested in design and user interface, so after my BA I went to do a post graduation, in industrial design in the Faculty of Fine Arts in the university of Lisbon. Where I learned the principles of good design, design thinking, how to make impact with your products and most important how to make a positive impact with your products in peoples lives.</p>
        <p>After finishing my post graduation, in 2013, I moved to London, here I did an internship in design in a start up. During my time there, I had the opportunity to learn so much about the development cycle and how to interact with designers, from there came the understanding that the communication between designers and developers most of the time is not smooth. The requirements, technical specifications etc, make it hard. The design is one of the first stages of a product, and normally when it gets to the developers it hits a brick wall, and when this happens normally there’s not much time left to fix things. This made me realise if I could do both, it would be like speaking two languagues! I'm very passionate about learning, technology and trends are always evolving, you have to keep up with it.
        <p>  All this made me come to the point where I am today: I’m passionate about learning and about my work, I love a challenge, and want to be involved in everything design/tech related where I feel I can make a difference. </p>
